# NOTE:

Please note that the documents in this folder reflect our artifact
at the time of submission for artifact evaluation. We have updated our
artifact to reflect camera ready changes: these changes are reflected in all
other folders (except for `artifact-submission-materials`) as of
September 14th 2020.

# Start of original document

# Document Overview
The goal of this README.md is to provide detailed information
on AMS for purposes of FSE 2020 Artifact Evaluation. In particular,
we: provide instructions to rebuild AMS or alternatively use a pre-packaged
VM, detail the relation of different source files/outputs to the paper,
provide instructions on reproducing these results.

Users who are interested in using/installing AMS (but not interested
in details relating to artifact evaluation) can instead focus on
the INSTALL.md file.

# AMS
AMS is a tool to automatically generate AutoML search spaces from
users' weak specifications. A weak specification is defined a set
of API classes to include in the AutoML search space. AMS then
extends this set with complementary classes, functionally-related classes,
and relevant hyperparameters and possible values. This configuration can
then be paired with existing search techniques to generate ML pipelines.
AMS relies on API documentation and corpus of code examples to strengthen
the input weak spec.

# Artifact
You can download a VM (if you are not already using it) from
https://ams-fse.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ams.ova .

The DOI for this artifact is
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3870818.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3870818)


```bash
$ wget https://ams-fse.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/ams.ova
```
The should result in a `.ova` (format version 1.0) that can be imported into
virtualbox or vmware. This image was exported and tested with Virtualbox version 6.0.

Once you load the VM into your preferred platform, you should navigate to
the `ams` folder and activate the `conda` environment.

```bash
$ cd ~/ams/
$ conda activate ams-env
```

If you are interested in seeing the `ams` repository (which
reiterates reproduction steps), please clone as below

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:josepablocam/ams.git
```

# Resizing the Virtual Machine Disk
Based on artifact reviewer feedback, we provide instructions on resizing
the VM disk for easier usage (in particular, this may help if you hit
the space limit when downloading datasets). We *did not* upload a resized
VM as this would require generating a new DOI (since DOIs are unique)
and could potentially be more confusing downstream.

We tested our resize instructions using Virtualbox 6.0.

In Virtualbox:
* navigate to `File/Virtual Media Manager` (Ctrl+D is a possible shortcut)
* Pick `Hard disks`
* Choose `ams-disk002.vdi`
* Using the slide increase the size to the desired size (e.g. 50GB).
* Click `Apply`

We now need to increase the root partition size.
You will want to download the `gparted` utility (https://gparted.org/download.php).
In Virtualbox, you will now want to

* Navigate to the AMS VM (make sure it is off)
* Click `Settings`
* Select `Storage`, and in the menus pick `Controller: IDE` and click on `Empty`. You will now see a CD logo on the right hand side, click on that and point it to the `.iso` file downloaded for `gparted`.
* Now, you can relaunch the VM.
* This will take you (after a few menu options regarding language) to the `gparted` utility.
* In the `gparted` utility, you can delete the current swap space, and then extent the current partition to fill in the new allocated disk space (leaving some amount for swap at the end).

You can now startup the VM. Launch terminal, and confirm that the disk size has been increased:

```bash
$ df -h
```

should show the new size (e.g. 50GB - swap space).

Different websites provide tutorials, so we also recommend looking at those if you are working with a different VM manager or run into any issues.


# Reproducing FSE evaluation
You can reproduce FSE experiments and figures by using scripts in
`scripts/fse/`. As others, these should be run from the root AMS directory.
Given that some of the experiments explained below take on the order of days
to run on a well-provisioned machine, we provide a download of our experimental
results. (If you are using the artifact VM, these results have already been
loaded and you can skip the following step).

### Datasets and Internet Connection
Note that running experiments requires access to the internet, in order
to download datasets. Alternatively, you can download all datasets first,
and then (offline) run experiments. *If you are using the artifact VM,
you do not need to download datasets, as they have been downloaded for you*.

You can download the necessary datasets by running

```bash
$ bash scripts/fse/download_datasets.sh
```

### Downloading Results
If you want to download the results, you can run

```bash
$ bash scripts/fse/download_results.sh
```

This will download results from an AWS S3 bucket and will place results in
`$RESULTS` and `$ANALYSIS_DIR`. In particular,

`${RESULTS}` will now contain folders of the form `q[0-9]+`, one for each of
the 15 weak specifications in our experiments. In it, you will find the
weak specification (`simple_config.json`),
the specification with expert-defined hyperparameters (`simple_config_with_params_dict.json`), and the AMS-generated search space
(`gen_config.json`).

The folder `random` contains results (again organized by weak specification
experiment) when using random search, while `tpot` contains results
when using genetic programming (the TPOT tool).

`rule-mining/` has experimental results for the complementary component
experiments.

#### Tables and Figures

The folder `$ANALYSIS_DIR` (`analysis_output` in the VM) holds figures/tables produced in analysis
and used in the paper. In particular,

* Table 2: `rules/roles.tex`
* Figure 3: `rules/precision.pdf`
* Figure 4: `relevance/plot.pdf`
* Figure 5:
    - (a) `hyperparams/num_params_tuned.pdf`
    - (b) `hyperparams/distance_params_tuned.pdf`
    - (c) `hyperparams/num_param_values.pdf`
* Figure 6: `hyperparams/perf.pdf`
* Figure 7: `performance/combined_wins.pdf`
* Figure 8: `tpot-sys-ops/combined.pdf` (includes extended examples)

(Tip: To open PDFs from the terminal in the Ubuntu VM, you can use `xdg-open file.pdf`)

### Scripts
`bash scripts/fse/reproduce_complementary_experiments.sh` reproduces experimental results relating
to extraction of complementary components to add to weak specifications. These
experiments should take on the order of a couple of hours to run.

`bash scripts/fse/reproduce_functional_related_experiments.sh` generates the data used for
manual annotation of functionally related components. We have already included
our manually annotated results as part of the artifact, so running this script
will prompt you to confirm before overwriting those with (unannotated) data.

`bash scripts/fse/reproduce_performance_experiments.sh` generates search space configurations
and evaluates them against our comparison baselines (weak spec, weak spec + search,
and expert + search). Running these experiments from scratch *takes on the order
of 1-2 days on a machine with 30 cores*. Given this computational burden, we have
also included our results in the artifact.

`bash scripts/fse/reproduce_analysis.sh` generates figures from the outputs of the prior
3 scripts and also runs some additional (~ 1 hour execution) experiments to
characterize the hyperparameters found in our code corpus.

The figures/tables are generated and saved to `$ANALYSIS_DIR`
(set to `analysis_output/`, if not modified in `folder_setup.sh`).
Please see the prior section for details on figure/table mappings.



# Codebase Overview
We provide a short overview of the AMS codebase:
